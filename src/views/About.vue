    <h1 class="title">Who needs Zoom? We Vroom!</h1>

    <p>Communication is at the core of society and digital communication is a central part of our everyday life.
      It is especially critical in times of crisis and limited mobility.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, current digital communication platforms are:</p>
    <p>1. dominated by a few big players, proprietary infrastructures, and business models based on data extraction and surveillance.</p>
    <p>2. massively limited by a mono-culture of representation. Much like Powerpoint has limited the range of expressions by
      forcing its users into the format of a business presentation, no matter what their actual context is,
      so do the current video-communication platform force everyone into the setting of a business meeting.
      On that level, there is relatively little difference between proprietary and open source software.
      Matthew Fuller's verdict on OpenOffice <i>"It's free software but not free  thinking"</i> applies here too.</p>
    <p>It speaks volumes that we even lack a proper verb for digital audio-visual communication and the names of the most popular companies
      of a given time are used to describe what was essentially developed for business-oriented video conferences.
      "Zoom fatigue" is real and caused not only by too much screen time but by too much monoculture: always the same grid of video
      images and audio settings that filter and cut off everything that is not recognized as a 'speaker'.
      This is useful in the context of structured meetings and conferences, but for many other kinds of social gatherings --
      cultural events, meet-ups switching between various one-to-one or small group conversations, artists or musicians performing together remotely for a remote audience including feedback and interaction -- this is hugely limiting.
      There is a lot of ground uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>To explore some of this ground, I created this first prototype. Contemporary base technologies such as a browser and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>
      would allow us to create more diverse technologies of video communication</p>
    <p>The tools we use shape us. Nowhere is this less apparent than in artistic creation and thinking</p>
