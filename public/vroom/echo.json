We are not a service provider, we are a community based project.</p><p>Contributers are responsible for the content of their own hosted event and for finding their own ways of providing content.</p><p>We aim to create an open-source, non-proprietary platform, where small and medium sized organizers can continue to host events, invite artists and therefore buffer the upcoming cultural drop out.</p><p>So, let&apos;s keep going and live solidarity!</p><p>Stay healthy and tuned!</p><p>Kontakt: <a href=\"mailto:echoraeume@klingt.org\" class=\"link\">echoraeume@klingt.org</a></p><p><b>Support your culture provider!<br/> Door money to:</b><a href=\"https://paypal.me/pools/c/8p5dnW2234\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">tip jar</a></p>"
